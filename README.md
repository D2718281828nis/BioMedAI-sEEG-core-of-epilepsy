# BioMedAI-sEEG-core-of-epilepsy
Biomakreks of sEEG timeseries analysis to find core of epilepsy as a dynamic process. 

## EDF viewer

Open [`sEEG_EDF_viewer_colab.ipynb`](sEEG_EDF_viewer_colab.ipynb) in Google
Colab to inspect the channel metadata, browse time windows, and plot the power
spectrum of `dataset/sEEG-HFOs-8.edf`. The notebook also explains how to upload
the file when it is not already present in the Colab runtime.

## Interactive discrete wavelet viewer

Open [`sEEG_DWT_viewer_colab.ipynb`](sEEG_DWT_viewer_colab.ipynb) in Google
Colab and run its cells from top to bottom. The notebook loads or uploads
`sEEG-HFOs-8.edf`, exposes every signal channel in an interactive selector,
excludes channels whose names begin with `MKR`, and lets you choose the mother
wavelet used to plot aligned approximation and detail components.
